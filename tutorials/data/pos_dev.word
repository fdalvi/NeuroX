The Arizona Corporations Commission authorized an 11.5 % rate increase at Tucson Electric Power Co. , substantially lower than recommended last month by a commission hearing officer and barely half the rise sought by the utility .
The ruling follows a host of problems at Tucson Electric , including major write-downs , a 60 % slash in the common stock dividend and the departure of former Chairman Einar Greve during a company investigation of his stock sales .
The Arizona regulatory ruling calls for $ 42 million in added revenue yearly , compared with a $ 57 million boost proposed by the commission hearing officer .
The company had sought increases totaling $ 80.3 million , or 22 % .
The decision was announced after trading ended .
Tucson Electric closed at $ 20.875 a share , down 25 cents , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
